<h1>This is private worker hosting or (pwh)</h1>

you can host your code to be computed here for completely free,
it is NOT free server hosting (we hope to make that later)

>[!WARNING]
>any code can be accessed by anyone, so do not add api keys or passwords to your site for now
<br>
<hr>
<br>
you want to contribute, put this code in high traffic sites (or not) <br> and your users will power our private servers 
<br>

```html
<script src='urlforthis.github.io'></script>
```
<br>
copy that and you can contirbute to the large computing power of the private worker hosting
